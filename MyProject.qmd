# My Final Year Project
My final year project prior to entering SIT is a web application that visualizes the sentiment analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19. The application allows users to explore the sentiments expressed in tweets about COVID-19 over time and across different regions. The project involved data collection, preprocessing, sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques, and creating interactive visualizations using R Shiny.
